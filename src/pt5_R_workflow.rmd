This is an example showing you how to get started with RMarkdown. Some sample text *italics*, **bold**

### Some Header
some text under that header

#### Subsection
some more text

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- c(1,2,3)
x + 5
```

These are the two commands required to install tinytex on your machine if you want to write latex equations and/or knit documents to pdf. Run these in the console if you that's something you're interested in:  

```{r, eval = FALSE}  
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
